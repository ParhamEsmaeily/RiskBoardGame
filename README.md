# RiskBoardGame
Command line risk board game developed in C++, very similar to Conquest.

## Getting Started
It's heavily recommended to run the root CMake project, where you will find options to run each part individually (when applicable).

To do so, start by running the following command in the current directory to configure the project:
```bash
cmake . -B build
```

Next, run this command to build the `MainDriver`:
```bash
cmake --build build
```

Finally, run the produced executable called `MainDriver` in the `build` folder.
